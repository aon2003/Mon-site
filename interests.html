                    My name is Ahmed, and since I was a child, I have always been a bit different from other kids.
                    I had no interest in typical childhood games or video games.
                    Instead, I was more drawn to adults discussing important topics.
                    I always paid close attention to learn from them, develop my own opinions, and become an active citizen with my own voice in my country.
                    That's why I became passionate about politics and economics.
                    This passion was further reinforced by the country where I lived previously.
